# ðŸ“š DSA Practice â€” Level 1: 1D Array Problems

This repository contains basic to intermediate problems focused on 1D array manipulation using Java. These problems are designed to build a solid foundation in array operations and logical thinking for coding interviews and programming fundamentals.

## ðŸ“˜ Problem 1: Reverse Array In-Place

ðŸ§  **Problem Statement**  
Given an array of integers, reverse the array in-place without using any additional array.

âœ… **Example**  
Input: `arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`  
Output: `arr = {5, 4, 3, 2, 1}`

---

## ðŸ“˜ Problem 2: Check if Array is Sorted and Strictly Increasing

ðŸ§  **Problem Statement**  
Check if the given array is sorted in strictly increasing order.

âœ… **Example**  
Input: `arr = {1, 2, 3, 4}`  
Output: `true`

---

## ðŸ“˜ Problem 3: Find Maximum and Minimum without Library Functions

ðŸ§  **Problem Statement**  
Find the maximum and minimum elements in an array without using any built-in functions.

âœ… **Example**  
Input: `arr = {4, 2, 9, 1, 5}`  
Output: `Max = 9, Min = 1`

---

## ðŸ“˜ Problem 4: Count Occurrences of a Target Element

ðŸ§  **Problem Statement**  
Given an array and a target element, count how many times the target appears in the array.

âœ… **Example**  
Input: `arr = {1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 4}`, target = `2`  
Output: `3`

---

## ðŸ“˜ Problem 5: Insert and Delete at Index in Fixed Array

ðŸ§  **Problem Statement**  
Implement manual insertion and deletion of an element at a specific index in a fixed-size array.

âœ… **Example**  
Insert `9` at index `2`:  
Input: `arr = {1, 2, 3, 4}`, Output: `arr = {1, 2, 9, 3, 4}`

---

## ðŸ“˜ Problem 6: Find the Second Largest Element

ðŸ§  **Problem Statement**  
Find the second largest element in an array. Handle edge cases such as all elements being equal.

âœ… **Example**  
Input: `arr = {3, 5, 1, 2, 5}`  
Output: `3`

---

## ðŸ“˜ Problem 7: Left Rotate the Array by One

ðŸ§  **Problem Statement**  
Rotate the array elements to the left by one position.

âœ… **Example**  
Input: `arr = {1, 2, 3, 4}`  
Output: `arr = {2, 3, 4, 1}`

---

## ðŸ“˜ Problem 8: Rotate Array by K Places (Naive & Optimized)

ðŸ§  **Problem Statement**  
Rotate the array to the right by `k` positions. Implement both the naive and the optimized approach.

âœ… **Example**  
Input: `arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`, `k = 2`  
Output: `arr = {4, 5, 1, 2, 3}`

---

## ðŸ“˜ Problem 9: Check if Array is Palindrome

ðŸ§  **Problem Statement**  
Check whether the given array is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).

âœ… **Example**  
Input: `arr = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1}`  
Output: `true`

---

## ðŸ“˜ Problem 10: Check Majority Element (> n/2 times)

ðŸ§  **Problem Statement**  
Find if there is an element in the array that appears more than `n/2` times.

âœ… **Example**  
Input: `arr = {2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2}`  
Output: `2`
